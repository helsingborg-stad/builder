## Summary
This composer plugin will check for build and cleanup configuration on composer packages that is being installed from the same composer.json file.
The intended usage for this is in build pipeline and local development environment.

## Requirements
- [PHP 7.4 or higher](https://www.php.net/)

## Install
```bash
composer require helsingborg-stad/builder
```

## Build command
I any composer package that need to be built the below should be in composer.json file like this.
```json
{
    "extra": {
        "builder": {
            "commands": [
                "npm ci",
                "npm run build",
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

## Cleanup
Any files that should be cleaned up after build in required packages should be in the composer.json file like this.
```json
{
    "extra": {
        "builder": {
            "removables": [
                ".git",
                ".gitignore"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

### Pipeline commands example
When running build for production the enable cleanup config should be enabled before install.  
This should BE USED WITH CAUTION as it will delete files from your system and the setting should not be commited but added during build in a pipeline.

```bash
composer config extra.builder.cleanup true
composer install
```
This will be added in the composer.json
```json
    "extra": {
        "builder": {
            "cleanup": "true"
        }
    }
```

### Run tests
```bash
composer install
composer run test
```
